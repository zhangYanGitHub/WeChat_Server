  <!-- Servlet Filters ================================================ -->

  <!--
    - Declare a filter for multipart MIME handling
    -->


  <!--
    - Use the Cocoon debug filter together with the Cocoon demo webapp
  <filter-mapping>
    <filter-name>CocoonDebugFilter</filter-name>
    <servlet-name>Cocoon</servlet-name>
  </filter-mapping>

  <!-- Servlet Context Listener ======================================= -->

  <!--
    - Declare Spring context listener which sets up the Spring Application Context
    - containing all Cocoon components (and user defined beans as well).
    -->
  <listener>
    <listener-class>org.springframework.web.context.ContextLoaderListener</listener-class>
  </listener>

  <!--
    - Declare Spring request listener which sets up the required RequestAttributes
    - to support Springs and Cocoon custom bean scopes like the request scope or the
    - session scope.
    -->
  <listener>
    <listener-class>org.springframework.web.context.request.RequestContextListener</listener-class>
  </listener>

  <!-- Servlet Configuration ========================================== -->

  <!--
    - Servlet that dispatches requests to the Spring managed block servlets
    -->


  <!-- URL space mappings ============================================= -->

  <!--
    - Cocoon handles all the URL space assigned to the webapp using its sitemap.
    - It is recommended to leave it unchanged. Under some circumstances though
    - (like integration with proprietary webapps or servlets) you might have
    - to change this parameter.
